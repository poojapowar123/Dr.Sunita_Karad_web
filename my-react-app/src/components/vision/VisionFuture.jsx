          Dr. Sunita M. Karadâ€™s passion for education transcends the development
          of universities. She is a visionary dedicated to democratizing
          education through the thoughtful integration of technology, innovation,
          and values. A firm advocate of accessible, flexible, and future-ready
          learning, she envisions ecosystems that not only impart knowledge but
          also instill values, resilience, and a sense of global responsibility
          among students. She actively promotes sustainability, the Indic
